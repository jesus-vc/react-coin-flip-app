Storing Some lessons learned:

Learning Objectives:

1. Use callbacks when updating useState.
2. Practice passing functions.

Lessons:

1. Jest allows us to spyOn functions where the original function is replaced by a mocked function. This mock will have enhanced functionality such as call tracking and controlled behavior. 
2. Wrappers allows us to modify and control the returned output of the original function.
3. We can't update objects and arrays directly. React will still still the same reference. So we need to make a copy, modify the copy, and return the copy so that React sees a new reference and thus update state.
